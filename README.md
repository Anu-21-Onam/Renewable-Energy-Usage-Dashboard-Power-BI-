# Renewable-Energy-Usage-Dashboard-Power-BI-
The dashboard explores renewable energy usage trends over time and across geography, demographic segments, and income levels. It focuses on: 
- Energy source contribution (Solar, Wind, Hydro, Biomass, Geothermal)
- Regional and national performance
- Subsidy impact
- Urban vs. rural comparisons
- Forecasting of energy usage trends

# 🔍 Key Insights & Features
- ✅ Energy Source Breakdown: View energy consumption patterns across five major renewable sources.
- ✅ Subsidy Analysis: Understand how subsidy distribution affects cost savings across household types.
- ✅ Income-Level Impact: Evaluate energy usage and savings across low, middle, and high-income households.
- ✅ Urban vs Rural Comparison: Assess gaps in savings and adoption between urban and rural households.
- ✅ Yearly Trends and Forecasts: Visualize adoption patterns over time and projected future usage.
- ✅ Top Performing Countries: Identify countries with the highest energy savings and consumption.
- ✅ Fully Interactive UI: Use slicers for Country, Energy Source, Subsidy Received, and Income Group.
  
# 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out
- 🌍 Real-world relevance: Built to reflect actual challenges in renewable energy adoption and subsidy allocation.
- 📈 Strategic Insights: Helps stakeholders assess where to improve policy or investment.
- 🖥️ Clean & Responsive Design: Organized navigation, consistent color palette, and varied chart types.
